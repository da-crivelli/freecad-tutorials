# Scope of this repo

This repo has a few tutorials for automating stuff around FreeCAD.

TODO: add an index of tutorials here.

# Prerequisites
You need to match the Freecad Python version to yours. I'd use pipenv for this and create a new virtualenv with a matchin version:

```
pipenv install --python 3.8.10  
```

The other prerequisites are inside `pipfile`.
